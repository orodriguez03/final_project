# Final Project

This project creates an animated visualization of bird migration using Python and Cartopy. The animation shows the movement of birds tracked over time, with each point representing a location at a specific timestamp. It utilizes Cartopy for geographic projections and map creation. It includes features such as coastlines, borders, lakes, and rivers on the map. And animated bird movement with timestamped data. The code is done in Google colaboratory.
